### --- [Rainfall shocks and land use intensity](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/c8lz7lfn6bee1isg7wvvl/chapter_1.pdf?rlkey=xhilg6e3zcxgee9femy2apv2j&st=ftwzjqht&dl=0)
Growing multiple crops per year (cropping intensity) is a crucial determinant of agricultural
production, especially in multi-cropping and drought-prone regions. However, existing studies
assessing the adverse effects of extreme weather events on global food security, have primarily
focused on crop yield and area, while neglecting their effect on cropping intensity. In the face
of extreme weather, farmers may adjust cropping intensity - either increasing or decreasing it - 
which can mitigate or exacerbate impacts on overall production. Using district-level panel
data from India, this study examines how cropping intensity responds to rainfall shocks both
droughts and excessive rainfall. We find that rainfall shocks have an asymmetric effect on crop-
ping intensity: it declines in response to drought but increases under excess rainfall, reflecting
farmersâ€™ behavioral response to these shocks. This adjustment primarily involves changes in
cultivated areas and area shares of crops, especially that of water-intensive crops. Our results
also suggest that the crop diversification significantly reduces the variability of cropping inten-
sity to droughts, while irrigation proves ineffective in mitigating the adverse effects of droughts.
